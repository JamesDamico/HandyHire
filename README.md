# HandyHire

[HandyHire.us](https://handyhire.us)

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, handymen have been struggling to find work recently. Quarantining has made it so that homeowners are not comfortable having strangers come to their properties to work on projects.The main problem faced is that homeowners are not able to get any home projects done, as well as handymen having an extreme shortage of work. This system should be able to provide a means for both parties to get what they want, in a simple and efficient manner.
The HandyHire system seeks to put these handymen in direct contact with homeowners which allows both parties to share information with each other. Mostly, this information will consist of: project descriptions, availability, and COVID compliance. This web-based interactive system will be similar to other popular systems such as AngiesList or TaskRabbit, without having to deal with competition and bidding wars, and while allowing the homeowner to get their project completed. Any handyman or homeowner will be able to access this system by visiting www.HandyHire.us to start connecting with other handymen and homeowners in their area.
The interface consists of a landing page which contains some information on how to use the system, as well as easily accessed pages that will allow a user to create a profile, or browse existing profiles.Once a user navigatesto the Browse handymen page, location information can be input, as well as the field of work, to produce different handymen’s profile results for users to view. The profiles feature the handyman’s name, user name, and their location, as well as the field of work they are in and their average rating for workmanship. Once a homeowner has found a handyman they want to work with, they will be able to view their email address and reach out to begin a conversation. 
Handymen’s profiles have multiple pieces of information, designed to hold as much relevant information about their skills as possible. Handymen can add a profile picture for users to verify what they look like, a biography for users to view and get a sense of the person they will potentially be hiring, and location data based on the state and county they operate out of. Handymen can also post relevant skills, any certifications earned, and all languages spoken by them. Additionally, handymen are also able to post pictures and descriptions of previously completed jobs, so that homeowners can view their work and feel better about hiring someone. Being able to see completed work is an important part of trusting someone to work on their home
This system should provide a reputable and reliable solution for this current problem. It will allow homeowners to continue work on ongoing projects, as well as provide work and income to handymen who are struggling throughout the pandemic.
